## Notes
- Before playing the game, you will need to register or login with an email account/password.
- Minimum password length is 6 characters.
- Try not to fall off the platform/screen as a game over screen hasn't been properly implemented yet and the screen will be stuck at the current level.
- For whatever reason you fall off, you may click Alt + F4 (Windows) or CMD + Shift + Q (Mac) to exit the application.
- Only Levels 1 & 2 have been implemented, so clicking the Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 Buttons will ultimately do nothing.
- The settings page sliders will also do nothing.
- There is a small bug where not inputting anything in any of the input user fields on the register user page will redirect user to the login user page.
